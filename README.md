Detailed File Explanations
1. Controllers
AuthController.cs
Purpose: Handles all authentication-related requests

Key Features:

User registration (/api/auth/register)

User login (/api/auth/login)

Token refresh (/api/auth/refresh-token)

Token revocation (/api/auth/revoke-token/{userId})

Why: Separates auth concerns from other controllers, follows REST conventions

UsersController.cs
Purpose: Manages user-related operations

Key Features:

Get all users (admin only)

Get user by ID

Update user

Delete user (admin only)

Why: Implements role-based authorization for user management

2. Data
ApplicationDbContext.cs
Purpose: Entity Framework Core database context

Key Features:

Extends IdentityDbContext for ASP.NET Core Identity

Configures relationships (User ↔ RefreshToken)

Why: Centralizes database configuration and provides data access

SeedData.cs
Purpose: Initial database seeding

Key Features:

Creates default roles (Admin, User)

Creates initial admin user

Why: Ensures application has minimum required data to start

3. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Auth DTOs
AuthRequest.cs: Login credentials (email + password)

AuthResponse.cs: JWT + refresh token response

RefreshTokenRequest.cs: Token refresh payload

RegisterRequest.cs: New user registration data

User DTOs
UserDto.cs: Safe user data for API responses

Why DTOs:

Decouple internal models from API contracts

Control what data is exposed

Prevent over-posting attacks

Transform data for clients

4. Extensions
ServiceExtensions.cs
Purpose: Organizes service configuration

Key Features:

Database configuration

Identity setup

JWT configuration

Repository registration

Service registration

AutoMapper setup

CORS policy

Why: Keeps Program.cs clean, follows Single Responsibility Principle

5. Interfaces
IAuthService.cs
Contract for authentication operations

Why: Enables dependency injection and mocking for testing

IRepository.cs
Generic repository pattern interface

Why: Abstracts data access, supports unit testing

IUserService.cs
Contract for user management

Why: Separates concerns, follows Interface Segregation Principle

6. Middleware
ExceptionMiddleware.cs
Purpose: Global exception handling

Key Features:

Catches unhandled exceptions

Returns consistent error responses

Logs errors

Why: Centralized error handling, better client experience

7. Models
User.cs
Extends IdentityUser with custom properties

Why: Adds application-specific user fields

RefreshToken.cs
Tracks refresh tokens for JWT rotation

Why: Enhances security by managing token lifecycle

8. Repository
Repository.cs
Generic repository implementation

Why:

Implements common CRUD operations

Reduces duplicate code

Abstracts EF Core details

9. Services
AuthService.cs
Implements authentication logic

Key Features:

User registration with password hashing

JWT generation

Refresh token management

Token validation

Why: Contains core auth business logic

UserService.cs
Implements user management

Key Features:

User CRUD operations

Soft delete

DTO mapping

Why: Encapsulates user-related business rules

10. Configuration Files
appsettings.json
Stores configuration settings:

Database connection string

JWT settings (secret, validity)

Logging configuration

Why: Externalizes configuration for different environments

Program.cs
Application entry point

Key Features:

Configures services

Sets up middleware pipeline

Seeds initial data

Why: Modern .NET 9 minimal hosting model

Key Architectural Principles Applied
Separation of Concerns:

Controllers handle HTTP, Services contain business logic

Repository handles data access

Dependency Injection:

All major components are injectable

Promotes testability and loose coupling

Repository Pattern:

Abstracts data access

Makes it easier to switch data sources

DTO Pattern:

Decouples internal models from API contracts

Enhances security by controlling exposed data

Middleware:

Cross-cutting concerns handled consistently

Clean separation of infrastructure from business logic

JWT Best Practices:

Short-lived access tokens

Long-lived refresh tokens

Token rotation

Proper revocation

This structure provides a solid foundation that's:

Secure (JWT, Identity, role-based auth)

Maintainable (clear separation of concerns)

Scalable (repository pattern, DI)

Testable (interfaces, injectable dependencies)

Professional (follows .NET best practices)

The architecture can easily be extended with additional features like:

Email confirmation

Password reset

Two-factor authentication

Audit logging

Rate limiting

API versioning
